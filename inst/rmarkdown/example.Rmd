## R Markdown

```{r, echo=FALSE}
wired_divider(2)
```


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

```{r, echo=FALSE}
wired_divider(2)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, wired=TRUE, fig.width=9}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
